# IdeaHub

IdeaHub is a flask application that implements a platform as described in [info.txt](https://github.com/Suhana66/IdeaHub/blob/master/info.txt).

I undertook a personal challenge to style the application using only the Bootstrap CSS Framework and no additional CSS, when creating this project.


## Concepts learnt

1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
2. Flask Web Framework in Python
3. Jinja Template Engine
4. Bootstrap CSS Framework
5. Structured Query Language (SQL)
6. Sqlite3 Library in Python
7. Exception Handling in Flask
8. Server-side Session in Flask
9. Password Hash
10. Virtual environments in Python


## Installation

Python, which can be downloaded at this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to run this application. All the modules required to run the application are included in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Suhana66/IdeaHub/blob/master/requirements.txt). A virtual environment to run the application can be created using the following commands in the command line.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Inside the virtual environment, the application can be run using the command `flask run`.
